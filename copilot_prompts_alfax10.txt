You are tasked with building a modern, responsive website for "AlfaX10" — a company specializing in developing mobile apps, websites, and custom software services.

## 🎯 Project Objective:
Create a complete website based on the visual design provided in screenshots. The design is modern, dark-themed with accent colors of blue and yellow. Your implementation must be clean, commented, secure, and easy to extend in the future.

## 📁 Required File Structure:
Please generate the following files:

1. `index.html` - Main landing page
2. `styles.css` - Main CSS styles including dark theme and yellow highlights
3. `scripts.js` - Any required JavaScript (form validations, animations, etc.)
4. `assets/` - Folder to contain images, logos, and media
5. `README.md` - Instructions for developers

## 🧱 Sections to Include in index.html:
- Header with navigation bar
- Hero section: Welcome text and call to action
- About us: company mission
- Services: app development, website design, tech consultations
- Featured Projects:
    - `smart_app` – Coming soon
    - `Tahaqqaq` – Coming soon
- Testimonials
- Contact Form
- Footer with company info and quick links

## 🎨 Theme Guidelines:
- Background: dark (#121212)
- Primary text: white
- Accent: vibrant blue (#00BFFF) and yellow (#FFD700)
- Font: modern and readable (e.g., "Inter", "Poppins")

## ✅ Requirements:
- Use semantic HTML5 elements.
- Use responsive layout (Flexbox or CSS Grid).
- Ensure accessibility compliance (contrast, keyboard nav, alt text).
- Use meaningful `id` and `class` names.
- Add HTML comments explaining each section.
- Add CSS comments for each styling block.
- Ensure JavaScript is modular and well-commented.
- Sanitize all user inputs in forms to prevent injection attacks.

## 🔐 Security:
- Escape user input in JavaScript
- Validate contact form inputs (email format, required fields)
- Include honeypot field or hCaptcha
- No third-party script loading unless necessary

## 🔄 Future Development Notes:
Ensure the code is modular to allow addition of a blog section or dynamic product listings later.

Start with the HTML, then style with CSS, and finally enhance interactivity with JavaScript. Please maintain clean structure and include comments for every functional block of code.
